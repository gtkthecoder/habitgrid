# habitgrid

**habitgrid** is a privacy-first, serverless monthly habit tracker inspired by spreadsheet discipline.

No servers. No databases.  
Your data is stored privately in **your own Google Drive**.

## ✨ Why habitgrid?

Most habit trackers store your data on their servers.  
habitgrid doesn’t.

- ✅ No backend
- ✅ No accounts managed by us
- ✅ Google OAuth only (identity handled by Google)
- ✅ Data lives in your Google Drive
- ✅ Spreadsheet-inspired, high-discipline UI

If you delete the Drive file, your data is gone — fully under your control.

## 🧠 How it works

1. You sign in with Google
2. habitgrid gets permission to access your Google Drive
3. Your habit data is saved as a private file in your Drive
4. When you log out, the app loses access
5. Log in again → your data syncs back

We never run servers and never see your data.
